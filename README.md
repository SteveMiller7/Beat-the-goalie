## WIREFRAME

![Original site layotu plan](https://i.imgur.com/K06ohh7.png)

Using Adobe Illustrator I created my website plan. I had a good idea of the styling in mind when first imagining the site. Modern, clean lines and aesthetically pleasing were important. As its a game for all ages I thought the cartoon style for the game would be most suitable. 

# Aesthetics
The look of the site was created with the aim of being clean, fun and modern.

I didnt want to make it too fussy and take away the focus from the nice custom made game visuals.

# FEATURES

### Header

![Header image with title](https://i.imgur.com/neTj2Yx.png)

The header includes the game title "BEAT THE GOALIE". I chose the font as it is nice and bold. The element is responsive and line spacing has been set to look well spaced when on smaller screens. 

### Game Images

The visual aspect of the game is made up of images I custom made on Adobe Illustrator using assets from Adobe Stock.
When specific criteria are met the javascript calls the correct image and its displayed. The scores are then adjusted to suit.

The main placeholder image for the game was also custom made in Adobe Illustrator. It shows the ball on the ground before a shot is taken. 

### Score Bar

The score bar contains the 'Player' and 'Goalie' scores. These scores are incremented upon a goal being scored by the user or a save being made by the goalie. The user must try to score 10 goals before the goalie makes 5 saves. 

### Buttons

Choosing a direction to shoot will send the ball towards the goal and will result in a goal or a save being made by the goalie. Ive given them minimal clean styling. The arrows  work well with the overall look of the page. 
Included below the shoot buttons is a 'LETS GO AGAIN' button which refreshes the page and resets the score once the game is over. 

### Footer
