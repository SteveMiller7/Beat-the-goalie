# BEAT THE GOALIE

Beat the Goalie is a simple football based game where the aim is to score against the goal keeper.
Choose left, middle or right direction and hope the keeper doesnt save your shot. Its a game that can be played by all ages and, as its fully responsive, it can be played on a phone, tablet or computer. 
Play it on the sofa, at the park, on the toilet, behind your wifes back or even at your kids nativity play.

## FEATURES

### Header

The header includes the game title "BEAT THE GOALIE". I chose the font as it fits the football theme. I thought the lines through the letters reminded me of lines on a football pitch. It is also bold and eye catching.

## Game Images

The visual aspect of the game is made up of images I custom made on Adobe Illustrator using assets from Adobbe Stock.
When specific criteria are met the javascript calls the correct image and its displayed.

The main placeholder image for the game was also custom made in Adobe Illustrator. It shows the ball on the ground before a shot is taken.
